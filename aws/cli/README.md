### AWS 

The [aws alias file](aws/cli/alias) is used to provide shortcuts to common aws tasks.

For more detail, see the AWS Labs [alias](https://github.com/awslabs/awscli-aliases) page, and, or the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/micklove/76b2cb13ea4d86f4b5f4ec42b0f9939b)

## Source
Quite a few of these aliases originated from the awesome [awscli-aliases](https://github.com/awslabs/awscli-aliases) repo and, especially, from the various PRs or Forks that people have shared. So, thank y'all!
